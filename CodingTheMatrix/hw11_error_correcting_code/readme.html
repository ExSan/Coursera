 <span>Error Correcting Code Lab: Instructions</span>
</h2>

<p>
<p>In this lab, you will be implementing and playing with the Hamming code, an error-correcting code over <tt>GF(2)</tt>.</p>
<p>This assignment will require the classes <code>Mat</code> and <code>Vec</code>.  Please make sure that they are completed before attempting this assignment.  When using <code>Vec</code> and <code>Mat</code>, please make sure you are using operators such as <code>+</code> and <code>[ ]</code>, and not procedures such as <code>add</code> and <code>getitem</code>.</p>

<p>To complete this assignment, please carefully follow the following instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the detailed instructions for this assignment, <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/matrix/ecc_lab.pdf">ecc_lab.pdf</a></li>
  <li>Download the stencil, <a href="http://grading.codingthematrix.com/coursera/ecc_lab.py"><tt>ecc_lab.py</tt></a>, for this assignment, and move it into your <code>matrix</code> folder.</li>
  <li>You do not need to submit anything marked <em>ungraded</em>.</li>
  <li>Support code and data resources can be found at the <a href="http://resources.codingthematrix.com/">Coding the Matrix Resources page</a>.  Here, you may find <tt><a href="http://resources.codingthematrix.com/matutil.py">matutil.py</a></tt>, and <tt><a href="http://resources.codingthematrix.com/bitutil.py">bitutil.py</a></tt>.</li>
  <li>If you would like to use resources not specified in the stencil, please make sure to import them.  For example:
<pre><code>from matutil import *
from vecutil import *
from GF2 import *
from bitutil import bits2mat, str2bits, noise
</code></pre>
</li>
  <li>For each problem/task,
   <ol>
      <li>Test out your solution in the Python REPL;</li>
      <li>Copy your solution into the stencil file <code>ecc_lab.py</code>;</li>
      <li>Submit your solution by opening a console window, navigating using <code>cd</code> to the <code>matrix</code> folder, and entering the command <code>python3 coursera_submit ecc_lab.py</code>. The script will ask for your username and password.  They are located <a href="https://class.coursera.org/matrix-002/assignment/">on the assignments page</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>You can use the submit command to submit solutions for as many tasks as you like at one time.</p>
